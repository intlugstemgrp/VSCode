## Introduction

Hi I am Henry, a Mathematical Physics Year 1 student at the University of Edinburgh from Hong Kong. I am intrigued by Quantum Physics, Nuclear Physics, Cosmology, and physics in general. Academics aside, my hobbies include meteorology, chess, ducks, long-distance running, classical music, website building, wandering in Parks, and pretty much everything except dancing.
