Grace participated in my STEM project and agreed to feature [her essay]({% link _Existential_Risks/Bioweapons.markdown %}) in my website. Below is her self introduction:

**Hi! I am Grace, doing medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Although my course mostly focuses on biology, I have always wanted to gain deeper insights into other STEM subjects like physics and computer sciences. I also have a huge passion in music, hoping to sharpen my instrument performing techniques as well as acquiring a better understanding in music theory during my free time.**
