## Introduction
This is Michael So from Hong Kong, a medical student studying in the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I enjoy exploring the world, particularly the world within our cranium, while trying to blur the boundaries between arts and sciences. What I have to clarify in advance is that my seemingly serious and perhaps unsatisfied facial expression just shows that I am merely thinking during such exploration. Hopefully I can graduate from the medical school on time and serve the people in need, of course, while continuing to explore the world within ourselves.
