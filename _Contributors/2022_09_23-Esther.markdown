## Introduction
Hi everyone! I am Esther Cheung, a second year Biochemistry MSci student at Univeristy College London. I grew up in Hong Kong and am currently based in London. As an aspiring stem cell biologist, I am interested in the correlation between tumorigenesis, regeneration, and longevity, as well as the genetic and epigenetic switches involved in these processes. Academic interests aside, I am a hobbyist violist, violinist, and sci-fi writer. I'm also interested in pretty much any genres of music.
