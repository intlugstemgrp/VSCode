## Introduction
My name is Ichika, and I am in my penultimate year of BSc Cancer Biomedicine at University College London. I am originally from Japan and had been educated in Japanese schools except for 3 years in an international school. My academic interest lies in oncology, specifically about cancer immunotherapy as well as the genetics of cancer. I have also been working as a committee member for the UCL Genetics Society, which has bolstered my interest in genetic disorders. Apart from these, I like to play the piano and to study foreign languages.
