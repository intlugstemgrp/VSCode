## Introduction
Hey everybody! I am Allison Lau, a second year student at the University of Toronto. I am currently doing a double specialist in computer science and physics and a minor in mathematics. I am interested in quantum mechanics, and I am also learning quantum computing. I love math and I wish that I could have more time studying it! Academics aside, I am the vice president of the Cantonese Debate Society at U of T. I am also an amateur pianist and I enjoy ice skating, sketching, learning languages, and reading!
