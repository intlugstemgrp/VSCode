We regularly hold different activities, most of which open to the public ad do not require STEM knowledge beyond middle school or equivalent. Please refer to the "Announcement" section for our latest activities.

## Tutorials and Skillshares

Tertiary education is largely discipline-specific. Although we can learn specialist knowledge, the limited time we spend at universities and colleges cannot prepare us for the increasingly interdisciplinary research environment, not to mention other STEM careers not strictly pertaining to our degrees. Besides, our interests cannot be simply defined by our major or course alone.

We thought, what better solution than to amass a group of enthusiastic STEM undergraduates from diverse backgrounds, academic or otherwise, and share specialist knowledge we learned in class with one another? To widen out horizons, satiate our curiosity, and prepare ourselves for our future workplaces, our members regularly hold tutorials and skillshares on discipline-specific, niche knowledge and practical skills such as programming.

All of our tutorials and skillshares are open to the general public to further our mission of improving public STEM literacy.

## Other Activities

To improve public STEM literacy, we also plan to host a range of activities, both internal and external. Below is a non-exhaustive list of examples:

Hackathons or Ideathons

Quizzes or Olympiads or Science Competitions

Essay Competitions

Conferences or Seminars (external presenter application form)

Science Fairs (poster presentation)

Networking or Social Events (virtual or in-person meet-ups)

Outreach activities targeting children (tutorials and workshops)

Outreach activities targeting teenagers (GCSE/IB tutorials)

Collaboration with univeristy or college clubs and societies (eg: writing in club journals or co-hosting club activities or presenting) (interested club/society personnel please contact us at ouroborosaegian@gmail.com)
